# Java Interfaces - Design Patterns

## Overview

This collection demonstrates various aspects of Java interfaces, including:

- Basic interface definition and implementation
- Multiple interface inheritance
- Default and static methods
- Functional interfaces and lambdas
- Use of `Comparable` and `Comparator`
- Constants in interfaces
- Marker interfaces
- Callback patterns
- Full interface design (e.g., Shape abstraction)

## Key Concepts

| `4-functional_interfaces.java` | Lambda expressions and functional interfaces |
| `5-comparable_interface.java` | Natural ordering with `Comparable` |
| `6-comparator_interface.java` | Custom sorting with `Comparator` |
| `7-interface_constants.java` | Constant declarations inside interfaces |

## Benefits of Interfaces

- Support abstraction and decoupling
- Enable multiple inheritance of type
- Promote extensibility and testability
- Allow clean separation between what and how

Use these examples to explore how interfaces can be used effectively in real-world Java applications.
