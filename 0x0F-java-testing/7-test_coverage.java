/**
 * This file does not contain executable code but explains the concept of test coverage.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Refers to the percentage of code executed during tests.
 * - Tools like JaCoCo help measure line and branch coverage.
 * - Aim for high coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage metrics.
 *
 * Example:
 * To enable coverage in Maven:
 * mvn test jacoco:report
 *
 * In IntelliJ:
 * Run tests with 'Code Coverage' option enabled.
