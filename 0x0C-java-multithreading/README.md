# 0x0C-java-multithreading

## Overview
This directory explores Java multithreading and concurrency concepts, with real code examples to illustrate thread creation, synchronization, communication, and more.

## Topics Covered
1. **Thread Creation** — `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
2. **Thread Safety** — Synchronized methods, blocks, and atomic variables.
3. **Thread Coordination** — `wait()`, `notify()`, and producer-consumer with `BlockingQueue`.
4. **Concurrency Utilities** — `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `Callable`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`.
5. **Best Practices** — Avoiding deadlocks, optimizing performance, and clean shutdowns.

## How to Run
Use `javac` to compile each `.java` file and `java` to execute. Example:
```bash
javac 0-thread_creation.java
java ThreadCreation
